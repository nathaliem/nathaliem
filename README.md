# 👋 Hi, I'm Nathalie
👩‍💻 I'm a frontend developer based in Antwerp, currently working at icapps!</br>
🎨 I love creating small projects that help me in my daily life, as well as collaborating on bigger projects that help others.</br>
📸 In my free time I enjoy lifting heavy, portrait photography, and baking.
